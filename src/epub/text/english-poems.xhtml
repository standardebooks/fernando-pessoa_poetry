				<h3 epub:type="title">Antinous</h3>
				<p>
					<span>The rain outside was cold in Hadrian’s soul.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The boy lay dead</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On the low couch, on whose denuded whole,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To Hadrian’s eyes, whose sorrow was a dread,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The shadowy light of Death’s eclipse was shed.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The boy lay dead, and the day seemed a night</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Outside. The rain fell like a sick affright</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of Nature at her work in killing him.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Memory of what he was gave no delight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Delight at what he was dead and dim.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>O hands that once had clasped Hadrian’s warm hands,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whose cold now found them cold!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O hair bound erstwhile with the pressing bands!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O eyes half-diffidently bold!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O bare female male-body such</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As a god’s likeness to humanity!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O lips whose opening redness erst could touch</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lust’s seats with a live art’s variety!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>O fingers skilled in things not to be told!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O tongue which, counter-tongued, made the blood bold!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O complete regency of lust throned on</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Raged consciousness’s spilled suspension!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>These things are things that now must be no more.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The rain is silent, and the Emperor</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sinks by the couch. His grief is like a rage,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For the gods take away the life they give</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And spoil the beauty they made live.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He weeps and knows that every future age</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is looking on him out of the to-be;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His love is on a universal stage;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A thousand unborn eyes weep with his misery.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Antinous is dead, is dead for ever,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is dead for ever and all loves lament.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Venus herself, that was Adonis’ lover,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Seeing him, that newly lived, now dead again,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lends her old griefs renewal to be blent</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With Hadrian’s pain.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Now is Apollo sad because the stealer</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of his white body is for ever cold.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No careful kisses on that nippled point</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Covering his heart-beats’ silent place restore</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His life again to ope his eyes and feel her</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Presence along his veins Love’s fortress hold.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No warmth of his another’s warmth demands.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now will his hands behind his head no more</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Linked, in that posture giving all but hands,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On the projected body hands implore.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The rain falls, and he lies like one who hath</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Forgotten all the gestures of his love</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And lies awake waiting their hot return.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But all his arts and toys are now with Death.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This human ice no way of heat can move;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>These ashes of a fire no flame can burn.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>O Hadrian, what will now thy cold life be?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What boots it to be lord of men and might?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His absence o’er thy visible empery</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Comes like a night,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor is there morn in hopes of new delight.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now are thy nights widowed of love and kisses;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now are thy days robbed of the night’s awaiting;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now have thy lips no purpose for thy blisses,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Left but to speak the name that Death is mating</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With solitude and sorrow and affright.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Thy vague hands grope, as if they had dropped joy.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To hear that the rain ceases lift thy head,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thy raised glance take to the lovely boy.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Naked he lies upon that memoried bed;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By thine own hand he lies uncovered.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There was he wont thy dangling sense to cloy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And uncloy with more cloying, and annoy</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With newer uncloying till thy senses bled.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>His hand and mouth knew games to reinstal</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Desire that thy worn spine was hurt to follow.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sometimes it seemed to thee that all was hollow</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In sense in each new straining of sucked lust.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then still new turns of toying would he call</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To thy nerves’ flesh, and thou wouldst tremble and fall</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Back on thy cushions with thy mind’s sense hushed.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Beautiful was my love, yet melancholy.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He had that art, that makes love captive wholly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of being slowly sad among lust’s rages.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now the Nile gave him up, the eternal Nile.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Under his wet locks Death’s blue paleness wages</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now war upon our wishing with sad smile.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Even as he thinks, the lust that is no more</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Than a memory of lust revives and takes</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His senses by the hand, his felt flesh wakes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all becomes again what ’twas before.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The dead body on the bed starts up and lives</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And comes to lie with him, close, closer, and</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A creeping love-wise and invisible hand</span>
					<br/>
					<span>At every body-entrance to his lust</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whispers caresses which flit off yet just</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Remain enough to bleed his last nerve’s strand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O sweet and cruel Parthian fugitives!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So he half rises, looking on his lover,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That now can love nothing but what none know.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Vaguely, half-seeing what he doth behold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He runs his cold lips all the body over.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And so ice-senseless are his lips that, lo!,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He scarce tastes death from the dead body’s cold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But it seems both are dead or living both</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And love is still the presence and the mover.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then his lips cease on the other lips’ cold sloth.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Ah, there the wanting breath reminds his lips</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That from beyond the gods hath moved a mist</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Between him and this boy. His finger-tips,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Still idly searching o’er the body, list</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For some flesh-response to their waking mood.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But their love-question is not understood:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The god is dead whose cult was to be kissed!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>He lifts his hand up to where heaven should be</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And cries on the mute gods to know his pain.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Let your calm faces turn aside to his plea,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O granting powers! He will yield up his reign.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In the still deserts he will parchèd live,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In the far barbarous roads beggar or slave,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But to his arms again the warm boy give!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Forego that space ye meant to be his grave!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Take all the female loveliness of earth</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in one mound of death its remnant spill!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But, by sweet Ganymede, that Jove found worth</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And above Hebe did elect to fill</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His cup at his high feasting, and instil</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The friendlier love that fills the other’s dearth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The clod of female embraces resolve</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To dust, O father of the gods, but spare</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This boy and his white body and golden hair!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Maybe thy better Ganymede thou feel’st</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That he should be, and out of jealous care</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From Hadrian’s arms to thine his beauty steal’st.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>He was a kitten playing with lust, playing</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With his own and with Hadrian’s, sometimes one</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And sometimes two, now linking, now undone;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now leaving lust, now lust’s high lusts delaying;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now eyeing lust not wide, but from askance</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Jumping round on lust’s half-unexpectance;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now softly gripping, then with fury holding,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now playfully playing, now seriously, now lying</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By th’ side of lust looking at it, now spying</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which way to take lust in his lust’s withholding.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Thus did the hours slide from their tangled hands</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And from their mixed limbs the moments slip.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now were his arms dead leaves, now iron bands;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now were his lips cups, now the things that sip;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now were his eyes too closed and now too looking;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now were his uncontinuings frenzy working;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now were his arts a feather and now a whip.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>That love they lived as a religion</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Offered to gods that come themselves to men.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sometimes he was adorned or made to don</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Half-vestures, then in statued nudity</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Did imitate some god that seems to be</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By marble’s accurate virtue men’s again.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now was he Venus, white out of the seas;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And now was he Apollo, young and golden;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now as Jove sate he in mock judgment over</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The presence at his feet of his slaved lover;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now was he an acted rite, by one beholden,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In ever-repositioned mysteries.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Now he is something anyone can be.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O stark negation of the thing it is!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O golden-haired moon-cold loveliness!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Too cold! too cold! and love as cold as he!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Love through the memories of his love doth roam</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As through a labyrinth, in sad madness glad,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And now calls on his name and bids him come,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And now is smiling at his imaged coming</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That is i’th’ heart like faces in the gloaming⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Mere shining shadows of the forms they had.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The rain again like a vague pain arose</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And put the sense of wetness in the air.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Suddenly did the Emperor suppose</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He saw this room and all in it from far.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He saw the couch, the boy, and his own frame</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Cast down against the couch, and he became</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A clearer presence to himself, and said</span>
					<br/>
					<span>These words unuttered, save to his soul’s dread:</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“I shall build thee a statue that will be</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To the continued future evidence</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of my love and thy beauty and the sense</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That beauty giveth of divinity.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Though death with subtle uncovering hands remove</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The apparel of life and empire from our love,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet its nude statue, that thou dost inspirit,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All future times, whether they will’t or not,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Shall, like a gift a forcing god hath brought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Inevitably inherit.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Ay, this thy statue shall I build, and set</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon the pinnacle of being thine, that Time</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By its subtle dim crime</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Will fear to eat it from life, or to fret</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With war’s or envy’s rage from bulk and stone.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fate cannot be that! Gods themselves, that make</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Things change, Fate’s own hand, that doth overtake</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The gods themselves with darkness, will draw back</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From marring thus thy statue and my boon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Leaving the wide world hollow with thy lack.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“This picture of our love will bridge the ages.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It will loom white out of the past and be</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Eternal, like a Roman victory,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In every heart the future will give rages</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of not being our love’s contemporary.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Yet oh that this were needed not, and thou</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wert the red flower perfuming my life,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The garland on the brows of my delight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The living flame on altars of my soul!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Would all this were a thing thou mightest now</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Smile at from under thy death-mocking lids</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And wonder that I should so put a strife</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Twixt me and gods for thy lost presence bright;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Were there nought in this but my empty dole</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thy awakening smile half to condole</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With what my dreaming pain to hope forbids.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Thus went he, like a lover who is waiting,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From place to place in his dim doubting mind.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now was his hope a great intention fating</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Its wish to being, now felt he was blind</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In some point of his seen wish undefined.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>When love meets death we know not what to feel.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When death foils love we know not what to know.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now did his doubt hope, now did his hope doubt;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now what his wish dreamed the dream’s sense did flout</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to a sullen emptiness congeal.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then again the gods fanned love’s darkening glow.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Thy death has given me a higher lust⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A flesh-lust raging for eternity.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On mine imperial fate I set my trust</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That the high gods, that made me emperor be,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Will not annul from a more real life</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My wish that thou should’st live for e’er and stand</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A fleshly presence on their better land,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>More lovely yet not lovelier, for there</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No things impossible our wishes mar</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor pain our hearts with change and time and strife.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Love, love, my love! thou art already a god.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This thought of mine, which I a wish believe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is no wish, but a sight, to me allowed</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By the great gods, that love and can give</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To mortal hearts, under the shape of wishes⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of wishes having undiscovered reaches⁠—,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A vision of the real things beyond</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Our life-imprisoned life, our sense-bound sense.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ay, what I wish thee to be thou art now</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Already. Already on Olympic ground</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou walkest and art perfect, yet art thou,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For thou needst no excess of thee to don</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Perfect to be, being perfection.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“My heart is singing like a morning bird.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A great hope from the gods comes down to me</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And bids my heart to subtler sense be stirred</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And think not that strange evil of thee</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That to think thee mortal would be.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“My love, my love, my god-love! Let me kiss</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On thy cold lips thy hot lips now immortal,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Greeting thee at Death’s portal’s happiness,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For to the gods Death’s portal is Life’s portal.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Were no Olympus yet for thee, my love</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Would make thee one, where thou sole god mightst prove,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I thy sole adorer, glad to be</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thy sole adorer through infinity.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That were a universe divine enough</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For love and me and what to me thou art.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To have thee is a thing made of gods’ stuff</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to look on thee eternity’s best part.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“But this is true and mine own art: the god</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou art now is a body made by me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For, if thou art now flesh reality</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Beyond where men age and night cometh still,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>’Tis to my love’s great making power thou owest</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That life thou on thy memory bestowest</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And mak’st it carnal. Had my love not held</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An empire of my mighty legioned will,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou to gods’ consort hadst not been compelled.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“My love that found thee, when it found thee did</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But find its own true body and exact look.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therefore when now thy memory I bid</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Become a god where gods are, I but move</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To death’s high column’s top the shape it took</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And set it there for vision of all love.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“O love, my love, put up with my strong will</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of loving to Olympus, be thou there</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The latest god, whose honey-coloured hair</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Takes divine eyes! As thou wert on earth, still</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In heaven bodifully be and roam,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A prisoner of that happiness of home,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With elder gods, while I on earth do make</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A statue for thy deathlessness’ seen sake.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Yet thy true deathless statue I shall build</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Will be no stone thing, but that same regret</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By which our love’s eternity is willed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>One side of that is thou, as gods see thee</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now, and the other, here, thy memory.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My sorrow will make that men’s god, and set</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thy naked memory on the parapet</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That looks upon the seas of future times.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Some will say all our love was but our crimes;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Others against our names the knives will whet</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of their glad hate of beauty’s beauty, and make</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Our names a base of heap whereon to rake</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The names of all our brothers with quick scorn.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet will our presence, like eternal Morn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ever return at Beauty’s hour, and shine</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Out of the East of Love, in light to enshrine</span>
					<br/>
					<span>New gods to come, the lacking world to adorn.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“All that thou art now is thyself and I.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Our dual presence has its unity</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In that perfection of body which my love,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By loving it, became, and did from life</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Raise into godness, calm above the strife</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of times, and changing passions far above.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“But since men see more with the eyes than soul,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Still I in stone shall utter this great dole;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Still, eager that men hunger by thy presence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I shall to marble carry this regret</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That in my heart like a great star is set.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus, even in stone, our love shall stand so great</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In thy statue of us, like a god’s fate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Our love’s incarnate and discarnate essence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That, like a trumpet reaching over seas</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And going from continent to continent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Our love shall speak its joy and woe, death-blent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Over infinities and eternities.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“And here, memory or statue, we shall stand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Still the same one, as we were hand in hand</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor felt each other’s hand for feeling.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Men still will see me when thy sense they take.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The entire gods might pass, in the vast wheeling</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of the globed ages. If but for thy sake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That, being theirs, hadst gone with their gone band,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They would return, as they had slept to wake.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Then the end of days when Jove were born again</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Ganymede again pour at his feast</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Would see our dual soul from death released</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And recreated unto joy, fear, pain⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All that love doth contain;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Life⁠—all the beauty that doth make a lust</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of love’s own true love, at the spell amazed;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, if our very memory wore to dust,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By some gods’ race of the end of ages must</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Our dual unity again be raised.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>It rained still. But slow-treading night came in,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Closing the weary eyelids of each sense.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The very consciousness of self and soul</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Grew, like a landscape through dim raining, dim.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Emperor lay still, so still that now</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He half forgot where now he lay, or whence</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The sorrow that was still salt on his lips.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>All had been something very far, a scroll</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Rolled up. The things he felt were like the rim</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That haloes round the moon when the night weeps.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>His head was bowed into his arms, and they</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On the low couch, foreign to his sense, lay.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His closed eyes seemed open to him, and seeing</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The naked floor, dark, cold, sad and unmeaning.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His hurting breath was all his sense could know.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Out of the falling darkness the wind rose</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And fell; a voice swooned in the courts below;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the Emperor slept.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i11">The gods came now</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And bore something away, no sense knows how,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On unseen arms of power and repose.</span>

						<br/>
						<span>They feel like hands her bosom and her side;</span>
